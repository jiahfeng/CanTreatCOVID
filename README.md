# CanTreatCOVID

CanTreatCOVID is an open-label, randomized, and multicenter platform trial aimed at treating non-hospitalized patients who have mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection and are at high risk of disease progression. The main objective of CanTreatCOVID is to compare the efficacy of the standard supportive care and symptom control approach with a treatment regimen recommended by the CanTreatCOVID Out-Patient Therapeutics Committee. The trial begins by randomizing equally between the Usual Care and a new treatment regimen. During the trialâ€™s progression, the Committee may review interim analyses and decide to add, remove, or exclude treatment arms accordingly.

The repository includes the following files:

`fun.R`: The R source code for implementing the clinical trial design.

`simu.R`: A simulation study of the trail with two to four treatment arms.
